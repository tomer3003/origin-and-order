/* Spells — 2024 rules, transcribed from the user's own Player's Handbook
   (chapter 7) — NOT from trained knowledge, and NOT from the 2014 rules.
   The 2024 PHB rewrote several spells' core mechanics (Sleep, Color Spray,
   and Inflict Wounds all changed from attack/fixed-pool mechanics to
   different ones; Cure Wounds and Healing Word doubled their dice; several
   cantrips from Tasha's Cauldron — Control Flames, Create Bonfire,
   Frostbite, Gust — were REMOVED and replaced by one consolidated cantrip,
   Elementalism) — so anything sourced from memory of 5e in general is
   exactly the trap this file fell into once already. Every entry below was
   checked line-by-line against the actual chapter text.

   `text` is the FULL spell description (the user wants the whole thing
   readable in the tooltip, not a paraphrase — SRD-licensed spell text is
   freely reproducible under CC-BY-4.0 with attribution, given at the bottom
   of this file and surfaced in the UI). `higherLevel` is the spell's real
   "Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot" / "Cantrip Upgrade" paragraph, kept
   separate so the UI can label it distinctly, the way the book does.

   `classes` lists every class list (by `listKey`) a spell appears on —
   shared spells are defined once, not duplicated per class.

   `roll`/`saveAbility`/`scaling` are still here as short structured facts
   that drive the auto-generated TL;DR (see spellTLDR in app.js):
     "attack" — a spell attack roll (ranged or melee)
     "save"   — the target makes a saving throw against your spell DC
     "none"   — no attack roll or save
   `scaling` is a short paraphrase of `higherLevel` for the TL;DR line;
   omit it only when a spell genuinely has no `higherLevel` text at all.

   COVERAGE: all 391 spells in the 2024 PHB, cantrips through level 9
   (34 / 64 / 63 / 52 / 41 / 48 / 34 / 21 / 18 / 16), generated from the PDF
   text by tools/gen.pl and repaired by hand where the PDF loses glyphs or
   flattens tables (see PROGRESS.md). Regenerate rather than hand-edit. */

If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered. The glyph is nearly imperceptible and requires a successful Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to notice.

For glyphs inscribed within an object, common triggers include opening that object or seeing the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.

A Celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a Fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you. A task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 GP per minute.

The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. The DM rolls 1d100 and consults the Teleportation Outcome table and the explanations after it. Teleportation Outcome (d100): Permanent circle, On Target 01-00. Linked object, On Target 01-00.

Here are the meanings of the terms in the table's Familiarity column: \"Permanent circle\" means a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know. \"Linked object\" means you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard's library. \"Very familiar\" is a place you have visited often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell. \"Seen casually\" is a place you have seen more than once but with which you aren't very familiar. \"Viewed once or described\" is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic, or a place you know through someone else's description, perhaps from a map. \"False destination\" is a place that doesn't exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a location that no longer exists. Mishap. The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 Force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).

Alternatively, you shape the wall into a globe up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point within range. The wall lasts for the duration. If you position the wall in a space occupied by a creature, the spell ends instantly without effect. The wall sheds Bright Light within 100 feet and Dim Light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate when you cast the spell can pass through and be near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have the Blinded condition for 1 minute. The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature reaches into or passes through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the layers. Each layer forces the creature to make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer's properties as described in the Prismatic Layers table. The wall, which has AC 10, can be destroyed one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. If a layer is destroyed, it is gone for the duration. Antimagic Field has no effect on the wall, and Dispel Magic can affect only the violet layer. Prismatic Layers Order Effects 1 Red. Failed Save: 12d6 Fire damage. Successful Save: Half as much damage. Additional Effects: Nonmagical ranged attacks can't pass through this layer, which is destroyed if it takes at least 25 Cold damage. 2 Orange. Failed Save: 12d6 Acid damage. Successful Save: Half as much damage. Additional Effects: Magical ranged attacks can't pass through this layer, which is destroyed by a strong wind (such as the one created by Gust of Wind). 3 Yellow. Failed Save: 12d6 Lightning damage. Successful Save: Half as much damage. Additional Effects: The layer is destroyed if it takes at least 60 Force damage. 4 Green. Failed Save: 12d6 Poison damage. Successful Save: Half as much damage. Additional Effects: A Passwall spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer. 5 Blue. Failed Save: 12d6 Cold damage. Successful Save: Half as much damage. Additional Effects: The layer is destroyed if it takes at least 25 Fire damage. 6 Indigo. Failed Save: The target has the Restrained condition and makes a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the condition ends. If it fails three times, it has the Petrified condition until it is freed by an effect like the Greater Restoration spell. The successes and failures needn't be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind. Additional Effects: Spells can't be cast through this layer, which is destroyed by Bright Light shed by the Daylight spell. 7 Violet. Failed Save: The target has the Blinded condition and makes a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the condition ends. On a failed save, the condition ends, and the creature teleports to another plane of existence (DM's choice). Additional Effects: This layer is destroyed by Dispel Magic.",

    text: "Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality itself. The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of level 8 or lower. If you use it this way, you don't need to meet any requirements to cast that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect. Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice: Object Creation. You create one object of up to 25,000 GP in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space that you can see on the ground. Instant Health. You allow yourself and up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all Hit Points, and you end all effects on them listed in the Greater Restoration spell. Resistance. You grant up to ten creatures that you can see Resistance to one damage type that you choose. This Resistance is permanent. Spell Immunity. You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. Sudden Learning. You replace one of your feats with another feat for which you are eligible. You lose all the benefits of the old feat and gain the benefits of the new one. You can't replace a feat that is a prerequisite for any of your other feats or features. Roll Redo. You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any die roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a Wish spell could undo an ally's failed saving throw or a foe's Critical Hit. You can force the reroll to be made with Advantage or Disadvantage, and you choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll. Reshape Reality. You may wish for something not included in any of the other effects. To do so, state your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might be achieved only in part, or you might suffer an unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a Legendary magic item or an Artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner. If your wish is granted and its effects have consequences for a whole community, region, or world, you are likely to attract powerful foes. If your wish would affect a god, the god's divine servants might instantly intervene to prevent it or to encourage you to craft the wish in a particular way. If your wish would undo the multiverse itself, threaten the City of Sigil, or affect the Lady of Pain in any way, you see an image of her in your mind for a moment; she shakes her head, and your wish fails. The stress of casting Wish to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a Long Rest, you take 1d10 Necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength score becomes 3 for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast Wish ever again if you suffer this stress.",
